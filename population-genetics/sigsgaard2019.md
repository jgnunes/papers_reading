# Highlights  
* (...) for eDNA research to attain its full potential within molecular ecology, the field needs to **progress from mitochondrial eDNA** to leveraging the much higher‐resolution information contained within **nuclear DNA**  

## Analyses with mitochondrial environmental DNA  
### Advantages of mitochondrial DNA  
* While mtDNA provides only one independent marker for population genetic studies, a major advantage for eDNA studies is that the mtDNA genome exists in **several copies** in each cell (Bogenhagen & Clayton, 1974) and that mtDNA appears to **degrade** at a **slower rate** than nuDNA

## On eDNA advantages over traditional tissue samples  
* an eDNA approach can offer ecological insights that are not accessible with traditional tissue samples, by **simultaneously** providing population genetic information on the **target organism** and the presence/absence or abundance information on **co‐occurring organisms**

## On limitations of the eDNA approach  
* (...) while certain vertebrates lend themselves well to the eDNA approach by, for instance, forming large feeding aggregations, other species **may require** a **large** and **well‐planned sampling** effort to obtain eDNA from a **sufficient number** of individuals  
	* Thus, determining the minimum level of sampling necessary for generating **reproducible results**, as well as outlining under which circumstances eDNA analysis constitutes an **advantageous** approach compared with **alternative approaches**, is of high priority for future research

## When eDNA is preferrable...  
* (...) at least for endangered, elusive, and economically important species, eDNA‐based population genetic methods offer an attractive avenue for improved monitoring and biological research.  

## Quantitative analysis of species/haplotypes  
* While the evidence published to date supports a good **correlation** between the relative **abundances** of **eDNA sequences** and the relative abundances of the **species** or **haplotypes** they **originate from**, further pilot experiments are needed to systematically test whether (or when) this holds true across **different environments** and **target organisms**.  

## Sigsgaard 2016 
* We compared mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region sequences obtained from PCR amplification and Illumina sequencing (metabarcoding) of **eDNA samples** (two polymorphic regions; DL1: 412 bp and DL2: 476-493 bp) to sequences from **tissue samples** collected at the same locality

* A mock haplotype sample prepared from known haplotypes indicated a positive correlation between DNA template concentration and read output, supporting a **quantitative** relationship between the two. 

* We retrieved more haplotypes from eDNA than from tissues samples, indicating that the tissue database did not represent the complete mitochondrial diversity of the aggregation.
