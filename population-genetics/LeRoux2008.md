# Applications of molecular genetics to invasive species management  

## 1. Taxonomic identity  
Identifying introduced species might be problematic in cryptic taxa, i.e, taxa that have different species morphologically identical. Identifying the right species is important because altough integrated approaches can be useful across multiple taxa, some management practices, in particular biological control, may be more productive or only effective against certain species or event variants (genotypes or biotypes) within a species. Then, molecular methods are useful because they allow reliable, rapid and accurate identification of variants and cryptic taxa.  

An interesting example of the consequences of taxonomic misidentification involves one of the best studied aquatic invaders in North America: dreissenid mussels. Until 1992, it was assumed that all US invasions involved a single species of zebra mussel, *Dreissena polymorpha*. However, genetic analysis usign allozyme polymorphisms revealed the presence of a second species: *Dreissena bugensis* (quagga mussel), that is currently displacing zebra mussels in parts of the Great Lakes. This taxnomic error puts the validity of previous life history experiments, specific invasion protocols and even genetic inferences about founder effects in doubt. This example illustrates accurate taxonomic identification as a fundamental first step to biological characterisation of introduction events.   

## 2. Determining the native provenance of invasive species  
Invasive species often have large native ranges, implying that it is not always easy to determine their geographical sources. However, it is of utmost importance to identify geographical origins when considering biological control as a management option, since the native territory is the region where we will most likely identify the enemy species/genotype to be used in the biological control strategy. Unfortunately, to date, very few studies have simultaneously investigated the native provenances of invasive species and the productivity of biological control agents from source regions. Typically, molecular biologists share phylogeographical data with authorities responsible for biological control programs. A study by Goolsby et al. (2006) gives an excellent example of such integration. Goolsby et al. (2006) analysed cpDNA data of *Lygodium microphyllum*, an invasive species in Florida, USA. The invasive haplotype was compared with those from the native range of *L. microphyllum* and subsequently led to an identical haplotypic match. *Floracarus perrepae*, the natural enemy of *L. microphyllum* throughout its native range, was also collected from all native range populations included in this study. Not surprisingly, the *F. perrepae* genotypes collected from the identified source population proved to be the most productive and damaging to *L. microphyllum* populations in Florida.

Determining the geographic source(s) of invaders is important not only to the success of biological control programs but also to understand basic processes in invasion ecology. Molecular techniques provide the only reliable way to determine source region(s) for species with large native ranges where introduction and invasion histories are not well documented. 

## 3. Hybridisation, introgression and invasiveness  
Increased invasiveness as a result of hybridisation has been document for several plant species and even for some aquatic species. This should be a consequence of the increase in genetic diversity of species/population after breeding with another species/population, and from uptaking favourable alleles from the other species/population.  

Molecular techniques remain the most reliable and conclusive approach to detect transgene escape through introgression. The positive correlation between hybridisation and increased invasiveness illustrates how the detection of such events will improve management strategies, for exemple prioritisation of contact zones for eradication and/or isolation distances between genetically-modified crops and their wild relatives. 

### Definitions  
#### Hybridisation  
Natural hybridization can be defined as the interbreeding of individuals from 2 distinct populations or groups of populations. Individuals in those populations must be distinguishable on the basis of one or more heritable characters.  
#### Introgression  
Introgression (or “introgressive hybridization”) describes the incorporation (usually via hybridization and backcrossing) of alleles from one entity (species) into the gene pool of a second, divergent entity (species).

Differential introgression, a phenomenon documented in many hybrid zones, refers to the observation that alleles at some loci introgress more than others. In theory, globally advantageous alleles will tend to introgress easily (“adaptive introgression”); neutral alleles will introgress to varying extents, but linkage to genes that contribute to local adaptation or reproductive isolation will inhibit their movement. Alleles will introgress little or not at all when they represent variants at loci subject to divergent directional selection and/or loci that determine speciation phenotypes (phenotypes that are responsible for reproductive isolation). Thus, patterns of differential introgression across hybrid zones potentially allow identification of genes or genome regions that are important for local adaptation and speciation.

## 4. Dispersal and spread of invasive species  
A better understanding of invasive spread and dispersal patterns has important implications for management. For instance, eradication of small pioneering populations in front of a continuous invasion front can be the most effective means of slowing or even stopping spread. Alternatively, invaders exhibiting long-distance expansion may need biological control agents capable of dispersing over equally long distances to keep up with their targets.  

Until recently, the invasive spread of *D. bugensis* (quagga mussel) in the Laurentian Great Lakes wash thought to resemble a gradual diffusion from the initial introduction in Lake Erie. However, microsatellite markers showed that leptokurtic dispersal (combination of rare long-distance dispersal with diffusive settlement) was the predominant pattern of dispersal. A similar approach was applied to endemic and envasive quagga mussels in Eurasia. In contrast to what had been observed in North America, the Eurasian populations failed to support isolation by distance, indicating that long-distance dispersal through boats frequently occurs within these regions. 

The indirect approach to infer dispersal from molecular data is a relatively novel approach and we anticipate that more studies will pursue this time and cost-effective avenue. The application of geographic information systems data to such studies would prove particularlly useful to further correlate dispersal with environmental factors.  

## 5. Genetic diversity  
Population genetic theory predicts that high genetic diversity predisposes invasive populations to success at establishing, persisting and dispersing into novel habitats. It is not surprising that population geneticists are turning their attention towards invasive species as model systems. The inference of the amount and distribution of genetic variation could also contribute towards better management practices. 

A strong correlation between higher genetic diversitites and multiple introduction events has been documented for many different invasive species. Invasive populations arising from multiple introductions from different native range regions accumulate genetic diversity, what facilitates local adaptation.  

Alternatively, genetically diverse source populations could harbour variants that are 'pre-adapted' to conditions in the recipient environment. In these instances, it is just a matter of introducing the right genotype(s) into the right environment(s).  

From a management perspective, the correlation between multiple introductions, increase in genetic diversity and adaptiveness to the new environment underscores the importance of preventing new introduction events. Additionally, genetic diversity may help predict the potential of invasive populations to evolve resistance to management practices such as herbicide or biological control.
