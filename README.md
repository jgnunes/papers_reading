### Update list of articles 
In order to programatically update the list of articles in this README file, one can clone the current repository into a local machine and then run the script [get_article_titles.py](https://github.com/jgnunes/papers_reading/blob/master/get_article_titles.py) at the root directory (the script was written in Python3):  

```console  
python get_article_titles.py  
```
