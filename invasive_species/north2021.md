## The five themes in invasion biology that could benefit from high-throughput seq
We discuss five broad themes in invasion biology research that have involved, or could benefit from, high-throughput sequencing. 

These are: 
* the role of preinvasion adaptation in enabling subsequent spread (Part 2);  
* tools to reconstruct invasion routes in space (Part 3);  
* demographic inference to reconstruct the timing of invasion events, which also sheds light on the role of population bottlenecks during invasion (Part 4); 
* in situ adaptation following introduction to novel bioregions (Part 5); 
* and the role of hybridization and introgression during invasion (Part 6), which brings together all of the preceding themes. 

These key themes reflect the focus of existing WGR articles in invasion biology and span the temporal range of the invasion sequence (Figure 1).

## 1. Measuring the contribution of preinvasion selection to invasion success  
## 1.1 Time-series data can distinguish between species destined for invasion and those that adapt in situ
One of the oldest postulations in the field of invasion biology is that some species are “predisposed” to invasiveness (Baker, 1965). In other words, some traits that facilitate spread in a new environment are **not adaptations** that arise following colonization (see Part 5), but instead **exist in native** populations prior to transport.

For example, Kreiner et al. (2019) used WGR data to trace the evolutionary history of glyphosate resistance, which facilitates agricultural invasion success in introduced Canadian populations of Amaranthus tuberculatus (common waterhemp). A combination of demographic modelling (see Parts 3 and 4) and scans for selective sweeps demonstrated that populations in Essex County were **introduced from native** midwestern populations in the United States, and carried glyphosate resistance alleles that were selected for in the native population. Therefore, adaptation had occurred **prior to the invasion event**.
