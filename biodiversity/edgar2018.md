## SSU classical 97% identity threshold
Data analysis in such studies typically assigns 16S rRNA sequences to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Many OTU clustering methods have been proposed, most of which use a threshold of 97% sequence identity.

Typically, this threshold is considered given rather than as a tunable parameter, following the conventional wisdom that 97% corresponds approximately to species (Schloss and Handelsman, 2005; Seguritan and Rohwer, 2001; Westcott and Schloss, 2017).

In this work, I used a high-quality set of 16S rRNA sequences from known species to investigate whether the 97% threshold is a good approximation to species, whether a better threshold can be identified, and whether clustering algorithms can be ranked by quality.

## Main result from this paper 
All algorithms had comparable accuracy when tuned to a given metric. Optimal identity thresholds were ∼99% for full-length sequences and ∼100% for the V4 hypervariable region.
