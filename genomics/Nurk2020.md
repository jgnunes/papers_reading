# Highlights  
## Advantages of HiFi data  
* Although HiFi reads are shorter (up to 25 Kb) than the traditional CLR reads (that can exceed 50 Kb) or the Nanopore reads (that can exceed 100 Kb), HiFi reads are much more accurate compared to other long-read technologies. While the median accuracy of the former can exceed 99.9% (>Q30), the accuracy of the latter do not exceed 95%.
