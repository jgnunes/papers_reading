The paper does analyses of specific gene families of interest for the study of the koala, such as the ones involved in lactaction, immune system, terpenes processing and olfactive receptors.
Besides that, it also does a genetic structure analysis, where it compares almost 50 different koalas from different regions of Australia and sees some genetic structure between those regions, establishing areas of conservation. 

Marcela had mentioned that the golden mussel paper could be similar to this one and indeed those are the type of analyses I was originally thinking about doing, given our availability of genetic population (ddRAD) data and our particular interest in some gene families. However I'm not sure that the golden mussel will show the gene family expansions that we've seen here for the koala, at least not for the gene families that Bio Bureau is interested in studying, since the phenotype of the golden mussel is not particularly different from other species regarding those genes. Can the absensce of gene family expansions make our paper less interesting?
