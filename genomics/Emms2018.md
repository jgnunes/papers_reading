# Highlights  

## 1. Comparison to other orthology inference strategies and justification for OrthoFinder development  
* (...) a number of methods have been developed that approximate phylogenetic relationships between genes using ‘reciprocal best hits’ (RBH) obtained from BLAST scores. Notable methods include InParanoid, OrthoMCL and OMA. However, common evolutionary events such as gene duplication can lead to misidentification of orthology relationships using these approximate methods that would otherwise be resolvable using phylogenetic trees of genes. As orthology is defined by phylogenetic relationship, it follows that relationships between genes should be more accurately resolved using phylogenetic trees. However, methods for genome-wide ortholog inference using gene trees are unavailable.

## 2. Main steps  
OrthoFinder is composed of three principal stages:   
  1. first, orthogroup inference;  
  2. second, inference of rooted species and gene trees;   
  3. and third, the inference of orthologs and gene duplication events from these rooted gene trees

## 3. Some possible analysis optimizations/customizations  
* "OrthoFinder has also been designed to allow the use of alternative methods for tree inference and sequence search to allow users to choose the balance between accuracy and speed suitable to their research. For example, BLAST 15 or MMseqs2 16 can be used for sequence similarity searches in place of DIAMOND, and gene trees can be automatically inferred from multiple sequence alignments using any user preferred alignment and tree inference method. Moreover, if the species tree is known prior to the analysis, this can be provided as input, rather than inferred by OrthoFinder."

## 4. Assessing OrthoFinder accuracy  
*  OrthoFinder (in multiple standard configurations) was submitted to the Quest for Orthologs (QfO) benchmarking server  
  * All versions of OrthoFinder inferred more orthologs (higher recall/recovered ortholog sets—see methods) than all other tested methods
