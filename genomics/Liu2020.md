# Highlights  

## Customized datasets and resources  
* Moreover, MolluscDB offers valuable customized datasets or resources, such as gene coexpression networks across various developmental stages and adult tissues/organs, core gene repertoires inferred for major molluscan lineages, and macrosynteny analysis for chromosomal evolution.

## Future directions  
* In the future, we will continuously update MolluscDB as new molluscan genomes and omics data become available  
* (...) and will add more annotation and functionalities to the database, such as the incorporation of multiomics data (e.g. epigenome, proteome, metabolome, phenome and microbiome), developmental transcriptome age-based analysis for evo-devo research (16), molecular marker resources (e.g. SNPs and microsatellites) for genomic breeding (52) and new machine learning-based tools for deep mining of multi-omics data (53) for understanding molluscan biology and evolution.

## From MolluscDB [website's FAQ](http://mgbase.qnlm.ac/page/help/main?FAQs)   
* MolluscDB also offers highly valuable, special featured customized datasets or resources that are not available elsewhere, including the gene coexpression networks across various developmental stages and adult tissues/organs, the core gene repertoires inferred for Mollusca and its decedent ancestors, and the genome-by-genome macrosynteny analysis for molluscan karyotype evolution
