# Highlights  
## Importance of a reference genome  
"When a reference genome sequence is available, sequence reads produced by any of the technologies can be aligned and positioned on a physical map. 
The higher the quality of the reference genome assembly, the easier it is to impute missing genotypes, thus reducing the coverage that is required to genotype each individual.
Reference genomes can also be used to design marker discovery experiments by simulating in silico the number of markers produced by different enzymes."
